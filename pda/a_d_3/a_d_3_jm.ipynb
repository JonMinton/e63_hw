    "- At least one attribute for each object with values indicated (e.g. “name: Alex”, “age: 32”)\n",
    "- Lines or \"relationships\" to indicate the structure of the objects and how they interact with each other. Types of relationships, such as many-to-many, do not need to be indicated at this level\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows three objects, `first_entry`, `second_entry` and `jblog` of two classes, `Entry` and `Blog`. \n",
    "The objects `first_entry` and `second_entry` are instances of the class `Entry`, and the object `jblog` is an instance of class Blog. \n",
    "\n",
    "The object `jblog` contains within it the objects `first_entry` and `second_entry` in its field `entries`. The links between these objects are shown with lines. The position of objects does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three objects from two classes](../out/a_d_3/three_objects/three_objects_of_two_classes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two blog entries are created as instances of the same `Entry` class because they can be expected to contain the same types of attribute/field, even though their contents can be expected to be different. \n",
    "Although only one instance of the `Blog` class exists, `jblog`, other objects of this class could also exist, and will be expected to have the same kinds of attribute/field. An important design decision is that instances of the `Blog` class accept instances of the `Entry` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the `Entry` and `Blog` class may be expected to contain relevant class-specific methods, although these are not shown here. \n",
    "For example, and `Entry` class object might be expected to have `.create()`, `.edit()` and `.delete()` methods, and the `Blog` class may be expected to have `.add_entry()`, `.delete_entry()` and `.count_total_views()` methods, the last of which might iterate through the `times_viewed` attribute of each entry in the `entries` list attribute. \n",
